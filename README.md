## Intro of Liar's Dice (HK Version)

Liarâ€™s Dice is a popular bluffing dice game often played in Hong Kong bars and social gatherings. The game combines chance, psychology, and drinking fun.
Each player has a cup (dice shaker) containing 5 dice.
In each round, we have to correctly guess the total number of dice showing a certain face value among all players, or to catch others bluffing.
We don't lose any dice in the game, and instead, we drink.

## Features
- Calculate the probability that a bid is valid given the number of dice and faces.
- Support for varying numbers of players.
- Interactive input for current bids and dice counts based on your trust to the player who makes a call.
- Support wild dice rules (aces as wild).
